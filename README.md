# Probability and Statistics

## Description

In this project, I work through the problem sets from the textbook [Probability and Statistics with R](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Maria-Dolores-Ugarte/dp/1584888911/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1507585567&sr=8-3&keywords=probability+and+statistics+with+r) by Maria Dolores Ugarte, Ana F. Militino, and Alan T. Arnholt.
